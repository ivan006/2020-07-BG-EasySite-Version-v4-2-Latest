# Name and Tagline
Startupify - A online admin system for startups

# Real world application
## Off the shelf or Custom?
Normally web apps are made custom for a client. This webapp is more able to serve as an off the shelf product. This is due to the nature of its database. Where most webapps use a relational database this uses a type of flat file database.
## Flexibility or Advance operations?
This variant of flat file database is valuable because it is user friendly enough that you can structure the data yourself without a developer. This is due to the fact that this variant of flat file database is very flexible. Relational databases are much more rigid. Flexibility has a disadvantage though as more rigid databases are able to have much more advanced operations performed on them. An example of an advance operation is cross entity analysis. An example of this is an operation that automatically counts the quantity of products in stock between branches in a franchise.
## Perfect match
But it’s ok because these advanced operations are often not required in startups. So this setup is perfect for beginner admin systems. On a side note in the initial phase of an administrative systems development it can really benefit from having flexibility.
## Type of data
This system can facilitate normal business data. Both internal and external communication/data. Internal communication like accounting documents and external communication like marketing material.
## Disclaimer
Although this is theoretically a good system for startup businesses it may have problems later. Eventually migrating your data to a relational format hasn't yet been conceptualised.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
